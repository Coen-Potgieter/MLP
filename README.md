# RNN

# Proccess:

- I want to implement an RNN in C++ using classes
- I am going to first implement an MLP since i know how to do that

### MLP proccess

- Fell at the first hurdle of creating the class
- Wanted to use arrays to manage the structure of the mlp
- This wont work since the mlp can vary in depth and width
- Thus, I need to learn Vectors
    - Back to C-PlusPlus repo
